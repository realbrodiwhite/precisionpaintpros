## Styling and Theming

### Tailwind Configuration (`tailwind.config.ts`)

The Tailwind configuration extends the default theme to include custom colors and fonts:

```ts
import type { Config } from "tailwindcss";

const config: Config = {
  content: [
    "./src/app/**/*.{ts,tsx}",
    "./src/components/**/*.{ts,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: "#1f2937",
        secondary: "#f97316",
        accent: "#10b981",
      },
      fontFamily: {
        sans: ["Open Sans", "sans-serif"],
        heading: ["Montserrat", "serif"],
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
};

export default config;
```

### Fonts

The application utilizes Google Fonts:

- **Headings:** Montserrat

These fonts are imported in the global CSS or directly in the `_document.tsx` file.
